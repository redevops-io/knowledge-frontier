"""Knowledge-frontier backtest — does frontier selection reach mastery with fewer teaching steps than
naive orderings? (plan §12/§21).

On controlled learners with a KNOWN concept graph and a fixed learning dynamic, we run the same
teaching loop under four selection strategies and compare how much understanding is reached within a
fixed budget of steps. The dynamic is the ground truth: teaching a concept whose prerequisites are met
advances it; teaching one whose prerequisites are NOT met is largely wasted and can seed a
misconception; mastered concepts slowly go stale (retention). So a strategy that respects prerequisites
and prioritises foundations should reach far more mastery per step than one that doesn't.

  * frontier       — the Knowledge Frontier policy (importance · prereqs · uncertainty · retention)
  * random         — a random not-yet-mastered concept (ignores prerequisites)
  * linear         — concepts in a fixed order (ignores prerequisites)
  * importance_only — highest structural importance, ignoring prerequisites and retention

As with the other kernels this validates the planning LOGIC on a controlled benchmark; it is NOT
real-world pedagogy.

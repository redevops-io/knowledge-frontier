"""Knowledge Frontier — decide what to learn/teach next to maximise understanding
(AGENTIC_APPS_PROACTIVE_INTELLIGENCE_PLAN §12, generalised).

'Establish the map before traversing every branch': rather than push a long sequence of disconnected
facts, model understanding as a prerequisite graph of concepts, track each concept's mastery state, and
pick the next concept by structural importance, prerequisites, uncertainty, misconception risk and
retention need — optimising demonstrated mastery, not content consumed.

This is a DOMAIN-NEUTRAL stack primitive, not a tutoring product: a 'learner' is any entity acquiring a
body of concepts — a person being taught, a new hire onboarding, an agent building competence, a team
closing a skill gap. (It is unrelated to, and shares no code with, the separate learnerbot.ai product.)

    concept graph + mastery state → eligible concepts (prerequisites met) → priority per concept
      (importance · expected gain · uncertainty · misconception · retention) → TEACH / REVIEW / ASSESS / STOP

ASSESS is the information-gathering move: a high *uncertainty* about a concept does not always mean
'teach it' — when our belief is also UNVERIFIED, the cheaper, higher-value move is often to probe
whether the entity already knows it, and only then decide to teach or move on. (For non-human domains
this generalises to ACQUIRE_EVIDENCE — inspect docs, run a test, query an app, ask a human — where the
frontier says WHAT is missing and the Mission/Context Runtime decides HOW to acquire it.)

Deterministic and model-free. Whether this selection POLICY reaches mastery with fewer steps than naive
orderings is decided by :mod:`agentic_os.knowledge_frontier_backtest` on controlled learners — not
asserted here. As with the other kernels, that proves the planning LOGIC on a controlled benchmark, not
real-world pedagogy.
